# GPU-Accelerated Image Grayscale Conversion

This repository demonstrates color-to-grayscale image conversion using four methods:

* **Pure Python loops**
* **NumPy vectorization**
* **OpenCV‚Äôs built-in function**
* **CUDA via Numba JIT**

The goal is to compare performance across these approaches and highlight the benefits of GPU acceleration for per-pixel image processing.

## üìã Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* NumPy
* OpenCV (cv2)
* Numba (with CUDA support)
* NVIDIA GPU with CUDA toolkit installed

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python numba
```

Ensure you have the CUDA toolkit and drivers installed for your GPU.

## ‚öôÔ∏è File Overview

* `cuda_grayscale_colab.py`
  Implementation of four grayscale conversion functions and benchmarking script.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dinonomous/GPU-Accelerated-Image-Grayscale.git
cd gpu-grayscale-conversion
```


2. Run the script on a sample image:
```bash
python cuda_grayscale_colab.py --input image.jpg
```

3. Observe printed benchmark results for different image sizes.

You can adjust image paths or add your own tests.

## üìà Benchmark Results (Example)

```
Benchmarking 512√ó512 image:
  Python Loops:  950.2 ms   (1.00√ó)
  NumPy:          12.5 ms   (76.0√ó)
  OpenCV:          4.3 ms  (220.5√ó)
  CUDA:            2.1 ms  (452.5√ó)

Benchmarking 2048√ó2048 image:
  NumPy:         210.3 ms   (1.00√ó)
  OpenCV:         35.7 ms   (5.89√ó)
  CUDA:            8.4 ms   (25.0√ó)
```

Runtime numbers will vary based on hardware. The CUDA approach consistently offers the greatest speedup on large images.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Python loops**: iterates pixel-by-pixel in pure Python‚Äîsimple but slow.
2. **NumPy**: uses vectorized operations over arrays‚Äîsignificantly faster.
3. **OpenCV**: leverages highly-optimized C++ routines.
4. **CUDA via Numba**: compiles a GPU kernel mapping each pixel to a CUDA thread for maximum parallelism.
