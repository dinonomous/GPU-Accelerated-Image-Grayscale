# GPU-Accelerated-Image-Grayscale
This repository demonstrates color-to-grayscale image conversion using four methods:  Pure Python loops  NumPy vectorization  OpenCVâ€™s built-in function  CUDA via Numba JIT  The goal is to compare performance across these approaches and highlight the benefits of GPU acceleration for per-pixel image processing.
